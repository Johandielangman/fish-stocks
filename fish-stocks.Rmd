# 🐟 Fish Stocks

📌 Full dataset available at [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/fish-stocks)

Fish stocks are measured by their biomass: the number of individuals multiplied by their mass.
Here it's measured as the biomass of a fish stock divided by the biomass at its maximum sustainable yield – the level at which we can catch the maximum amount of fish without a decline in fish populations. A value of one maximises fish catch without decreasing fish
populations.

    ) %>%
